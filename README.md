# House-Price-Prediction-Analysis

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction Analysis** project, part of the [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to leverage data visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into the dataset provided by the competition. Understanding the data thoroughly is a crucial step before applying any machine learning techniques. This project not only aims to visualize and understand the data but also prepares it for subsequent machine learning operations by cleaning and processing.

## Tools and Technologies
This project utilizes various Python libraries to aid in data visualization and preprocessing, including:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plotting and visualizations
- `scikit-learn` for data preprocessing and modeling
